# I've been studying intermediate React this week ðŸ“š

This project isn't too interesting, functionality-wise. We were tasked with building an "Instagram clone" to practice some more advanced React concepts. While I'm excited to move on to something new, I've learned plenty about the library and some common patterns for building UIs in React.

## Concepts explored

- React tooling
  - Bootstrapping with `create-react-app`
  - Prop type checking with `prop-types`
- The component life cycle
  - Mounting, Updating, Unmounting
  - Where `contstructor` and `render` methods fit in
  - Using `componentDidMount` to set state post render
- Component composition patterns
  - Higher order components
  - State Driven Development
- CSS in JavaScript
  - Importing style sheets in JS
  - Reactstrap
  - `styled-components` for centralizing component state, logic, and view in one location
