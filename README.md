# I've been studying intermediate React this week ðŸ“š

This project isn't too interesting, functionality-wise. We were tasked with building an "Instagram clone" to practice some more advanced React concepts. While I'm excited to move on to something new, I've learned plenty about the library and some common patterns for building UIs in React.

## Concepts explored

- React tooling
  - Bootstrapping with `create-react-app`
- The component life cycle
- Component composition patterns
- CSS in JavaScript with `styled-components`
